This post will be dedicated to my wonderful furchild!

Marco is a Pomsky who was born in November 2019 that came running in to my life in February of 2020.
I had been wanting a puppy for some time, but was struggling to make a decision. 
On February 14th, 2020, I took a couple bags of treats to the Lexington Humane Society, and spent the
evening spoiling the pups. The next day, while sitting at a basketball game coaching my cheer team,
my assistant coach told me about a puppy that was purchased as a Christmas present and then returned a
few weeks later. She proceeded to show me a picture of Marco, and I fell in love. After the game, I got
in my car, and drove 4 hours to meet him. The moment I walked in the door, he ran up to greet me and put 
both his front paws on my legs! I could not give them my money fast enough! He proceeded to spend the
next 4 hours sleeping in my lap on the car ride home.

He has been a blessing in my life since the day we met!
